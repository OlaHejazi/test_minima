"“Minimal Computing” is a Global Outlook::Digital Humanities (GO::DH) working group invested in the entanglements of computing with infrastructure and culture. I chair the group with John Simpson, and in Summer 2017 I taught a graduate seminar on the topic. That seminar drew from Hartmut Obendorf’s research (2009) to look at functional, structural, architectural, and compositional forms of minimal computing as a creative and analytical framework. Students and I foregrounded notions of access, infrastructure, labor, and persistence against various types of scope, function, and feature creep common in project design and development."
